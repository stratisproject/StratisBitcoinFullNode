    /// (in any direction). The median of the collected samples is used as the final time offset
    /// the node uses to calculate the adjusted time.

    /// behind its calculation and collection of samples that resides in this class. This class

    /// that affects the final offset is collected.

    /// to 2 hours. This is very unlike Stratis' POS, which uses very narrow windows for block
    /// timestamps. This is why we implemented our mechanism of time syncing with peers
    /// and adjusted time calculation slightly differently.
