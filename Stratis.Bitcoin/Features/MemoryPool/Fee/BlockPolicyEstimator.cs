    //  CBlockPolicyEstimator

    // The BlockPolicyEstimator is used for estimating the feerate needed
    // for a transaction to be included in a block within a certain number of
    // blocks.
    //
    // At a high level the algorithm works by grouping transactions into buckets
    // based on having similar feerates and then tracking how long it
    // takes transactions in the various buckets to be mined.  It operates under
    // the assumption that in general transactions of higher feerate will be
    // included in blocks before transactions of lower feerate.   So for
    // example if you wanted to know what feerate you should put on a transaction to
    // be included in a block within the next 5 blocks, you would start by looking
    // at the bucket with the highest feerate transactions and verifying that a
    // sufficiently high percentage of them were confirmed within 5 blocks and
    // then you would look at the next highest feerate bucket, and so on, stopping at
    // the last bucket to pass the test.   The average feerate of transactions in this
    // bucket will give you an indication of the lowest feerate you can put on a
    // transaction and still have a sufficiently high chance of being confirmed
    // within your desired 5 blocks.
    //
    // Here is a brief description of the implementation:
    // When a transaction enters the mempool, we
    // track the height of the block chain at entry.  Whenever a block comes in,
    // we count the number of transactions in each bucket and the total amount of feerate
    // paid in each bucket. Then we calculate how many blocks Y it took each
    // transaction to be mined and we track an array of counters in each bucket
    // for how long it to took transactions to get confirmed from 1 to a max of 25
    // and we increment all the counters from Y up to 25. This is because for any
    // number Z>=Y the transaction was successfully mined within Z blocks.  We
    // want to save a history of this information, so at any time we have a
    // counter of the total number of transactions that happened in a given feerate
    // bucket and the total number that were confirmed in each number 1-25 blocks
    // or less for any bucket.   We save this history by keeping an exponentially
    // decaying moving average of each one of these stats.  Furthermore we also
    // keep track of the number unmined (in mempool) transactions in each bucket
    // and for how many blocks they have been outstanding and use that to increase
    // the number of transactions we've seen in that feerate bucket when calculating
    // an estimate for any number of confirmations below the number of blocks
    // they've been outstanding.

    // We will instantiate an instance of this class to track transactions that were
    // included in a block. We will lump transactions into a bucket according to their
    // approximate feerate and then track how long it took for those txs to be included in a block
    //
    // The tracking of unconfirmed (mempool) transactions is completely independent of the
    // historical tracking of transactions that have been confirmed in a block.

    //  We want to be able to estimate feerates that are needed on tx's to be included in
    // a certain number of blocks.Every time a block is added to the best chain, this class records
    // stats on the transactions included in that block
