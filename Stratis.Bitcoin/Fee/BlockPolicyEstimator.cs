	//  CBlockPolicyEstimator

	// The BlockPolicyEstimator is used for estimating the feerate needed
	// for a transaction to be included in a block within a certain number of
	// blocks.
	//
	// At a high level the algorithm works by grouping transactions into buckets
	// based on having similar feerates and then tracking how long it
	// takes transactions in the various buckets to be mined.  It operates under
	// the assumption that in general transactions of higher feerate will be
	// included in blocks before transactions of lower feerate.   So for
	// example if you wanted to know what feerate you should put on a transaction to
	// be included in a block within the next 5 blocks, you would start by looking
	// at the bucket with the highest feerate transactions and verifying that a
	// sufficiently high percentage of them were confirmed within 5 blocks and
	// then you would look at the next highest feerate bucket, and so on, stopping at
	// the last bucket to pass the test.   The average feerate of transactions in this
	// bucket will give you an indication of the lowest feerate you can put on a
	// transaction and still have a sufficiently high chance of being confirmed
	// within your desired 5 blocks.
	//
	// Here is a brief description of the implementation:
	// When a transaction enters the mempool, we
	// track the height of the block chain at entry.  Whenever a block comes in,
	// we count the number of transactions in each bucket and the total amount of feerate
	// paid in each bucket. Then we calculate how many blocks Y it took each
	// transaction to be mined and we track an array of counters in each bucket
	// for how long it to took transactions to get confirmed from 1 to a max of 25
	// and we increment all the counters from Y up to 25. This is because for any
	// number Z>=Y the transaction was successfully mined within Z blocks.  We
	// want to save a history of this information, so at any time we have a
	// counter of the total number of transactions that happened in a given feerate
	// bucket and the total number that were confirmed in each number 1-25 blocks
	// or less for any bucket.   We save this history by keeping an exponentially
	// decaying moving average of each one of these stats.  Furthermore we also
	// keep track of the number unmined (in mempool) transactions in each bucket
	// and for how many blocks they have been outstanding and use that to increase
	// the number of transactions we've seen in that feerate bucket when calculating
	// an estimate for any number of confirmations below the number of blocks
	// they've been outstanding.

	// We will instantiate an instance of this class to track transactions that were
	// included in a block. We will lump transactions into a bucket according to their
	// approximate feerate and then track how long it took for those txs to be included in a block
	//
	// The tracking of unconfirmed (mempool) transactions is completely independent of the
	// historical tracking of transactions that have been confirmed in a block.

	//  We want to be able to estimate feerates that are needed on tx's to be included in
	// a certain number of blocks.Every time a block is added to the best chain, this class records
	// stats on the transactions included in that block
